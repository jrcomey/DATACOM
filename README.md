# DATACOM

#### Source-Agnostic Data Visualization Program

I wrote a general-purpose 3D visualization engine using OpenGL and Rust to serve as a visual terminal interface for a multitude of projects I have been developing. DATACOM is a source-agnostic program (meaning it can take data from any source, provided correct formatting) and can recieve and display multiple incoming datastreams.

Originally intended to serve as a command-and-control interface for UAV swarm behavior, DATACOM has evolved into a more general-purpose interface.

Not intended for public use. Repository has been temporarily made publically available for graduate school applications.
